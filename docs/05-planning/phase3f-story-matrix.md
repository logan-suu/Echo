# Phase 3F Story Matrix (Calibrated 66-Story Completion Matrix)

**Date:** 2026-08-03 **Scope:** Echo v4.6's 66 user stories. **Decision rule:** A story is **production-complete** only when every required AC is feasible, implemented on the default app path, and has appropriate verification. A source-level or fixture-tested AC is recorded in the evidence note but does not make the story complete.

This file is the materialized `Appendix C` of the Phase 3F execution plan (`docs/05-planning/phase3f-execution-plan.md`). It is read-only for 3F.1 through 3F.11; any scope change requires a human-approved scope PR.

> **Post-3F handoff note (2026-08-31):** DEF-001 / US-AWK-004 and DEF-002 / US-AWK-006 remain unresolved product-scope decisions. They have no Phase 4 implementation task today, so `4.10` Release Candidate is blocked until approved implementation tasks exist or the stories are formally moved out of v1 with this matrix and the specification updated together.

> **Phase 4 reasonableness update (2026-09-02):** Task-surface review corrected the launch permission sequence and the persisted-task recovery contract. `4.0f` now owns consent-first contextual permission requests; `4.0g` owns production task reconstruction and truthful Continue/Restart. Baseline labels below are retained for audit history, while owner/evidence notes reflect the current handoff.

## Ownership Repair (§4.2.1)

| Story | Owner Task(s) | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US-SRC-007 | 3F.7 | Encrypted user-mediated migration package export/import, Finder/iTunes encrypted local-backup restore, merge/conflict/integrity/reingest/ExcludedAssets behavior and live Settings integration. Not deferred. |
| US-SRC-009 | 3F.7, 3F.10 | Specification merged into US-SYS-001 with every original AC retained; 3F.7 owns live data-overview service, JSON export and Settings integration; 3F.10 owns production error, localization and accessibility behavior. Not deferred. |
| US-SRC-010 | 3F.6, 3F.8, 3F.11 | 3F.6 owns the search contract, 3F.8 owns HealthKit-backed system adaptation, 3F.11 owns no-fixture production E2E. Not deferred. |
| US-SRC-011 | 3F.3, 3F.3a, 3F.3b, 3F.6, 4.1 | 3F.3 owns E5 model semantics; 3F.3a owns SigLIP2 reference vectors; 3F.3b owns Whisper reference transcripts; 3F.6 owns subjective ranking and feedback behavior; Phase 4 4.1 owns Golden validation. Not deferred. |
| US-AWK-004 | DEF-001 | Approved product deferral (Widget / Live Activity). Counts toward the matrix only through the approved record. |
| US-AWK-006 | DEF-002 | Approved product deferral (Siri Shortcuts / App Intents). Counts toward the matrix only through the approved record. |

> Matrix gate: passes only when all 66 unique story IDs have at least one explicit owner or an approved non-v1 removal record. US-SRC-007/009/010/011 may not use the deferral path.

## Aggregate (exclusive primary status, baseline 2026-08-03)

| Status | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Production-complete | 0 |
| Partial | 21 |
| Stub | 22 |
| Absent/unmapped | 9 |
| Deferred | 2 |
| Impossible/spec-invalid | 12 |
| **Total** | **66** |

`Impossible/spec-invalid` is used where a required AC cannot be accepted without a specification decision (for example, unavailable public APIs, contradictory source rules, or impossible timing guarantees). It does **not** erase any partial implementation evidence in the notes.

| SRC-005 | Stub | 3F.2, 4.2 | Search scan surface is fixture-driven; no scanner/import action exists. |
| SRC-006 | Impossible/spec-invalid | 3F.0 | Spec/ledger explicitly defer it: PHAsset has no People identity API. |

| ING-004 | Impossible/spec-invalid | 3F.0, 3F.3, 3F.3a, 3F.5, 4.2 | Some ingest AC code is tested with StubEmbedder, but required direct text/vision-space alignment conflicts with the mandated E5/CLIP split. 3F.3a owns SigLIP2 Core ML conversion and real vision inference. |
| ING-005 | Partial | 3F.3, 3F.3a, 3F.3b, 3F.5, 4.2 | Video pipeline code and isolated tests exist, but actual asset acquisition and Whisper/SigLIP inference are scaffolded/unreachable. 3F.3a/3F.3b provide real vision/audio inference. |
| ING-006 | Absent/unmapped | 3F.4, 3F.5, 4.2 | No canonical transactional vector/text/FTS commit, fault-injection rollback, or transaction audit path. |
| RET-001 | Partial | 3F.3, 3F.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 | Search pipeline and stub-backed tests implement ranking/audit fields; default app injects no pipeline, E5 returns zeros, and no Cross-Encoder/Golden Recall gate exists. |

| RET-004 | Impossible/spec-invalid | 3F.0, 3F.6, 4.1, 4.2 | Some filtering code exists, but the AC retains person dimensions after person IDs were removed; actual filters are post-ANN/no-op. |
| RET-005 | Absent/unmapped | 3F.6, 4.1, 4.2 | No conversation context store, rewrite model, or parent-trace implementation. |
| RET-006 | Partial | 3F.3, 3F.6, 4.1, 4.2 | Low-confidence flags/banner are implemented, but no live Cross-Encoder produces the score. |

## Evidence and interpretation

- **Specifications:** `docs/01-spec/用户故事与验收标准规格书.md:45` defines the 66-story scope. Its own amendments identify SRC-006 as deferred and record model/API route problems (`:7-14`, `:181-185`).
- **Production source:** `Echo/UI/AppShell/AppRootView.swift:29-33` constructs default ViewModels; `Echo/UI/Search/SearchViewModel.swift:179-204,229-253` defaults to nil pipelines and fixture results; `Echo/UI/Home/HomeViewModel.swift:158-205` has no live card loading. `Echo/App/AppDelegate.swift:16-21` does not register background work.
- **Model/runtime source:** `E5Embedder.swift:42-44,125-143`, `SigLIP2Embedder.swift:24-29,62-69`, and `WhisperASREngine.swift:31-36,63-70` explicitly identify scaffold behavior / unavailable inference.
- **Tests:** `EchoTests/Phase3/Phase3IntegrationTests.swift:74-101` constructs a fresh VectorStore and `StubEmbedder`; `EchoTests/Phase2/IngestPipelineImageTests.swift:41-57` likewise injects `StubEmbedder`. These tests support isolated behavior, not default-app production composition.
- Fresh-run baseline embedded in the execution plan: no-fixture startup remained on "Echo is getting ready…" with no initialized data; unit tests passed 718/720 with 2 failures. These observations are baseline context only, not completion evidence.

## P0/P1 blockers (baseline)

### P0 blockers

1. **Production composition and first-run initialization:** no default wiring for policy, database, model/index initialization, or pipelines (`AppRootView`, the embedded Appendix A/C baseline).
2. **Acquisition and real inference:** PhotoKit/Share source paths and E5/SigLIP2/Whisper artifacts/inference are missing/scaffolded; this blocks SRC-001 and all real ingestion/retrieval.
3. **Canonical transactional persistence:** ING-006's atomic canonical/vector/FTS lifecycle is unmapped, blocking reliable ingest, deletion, and search.
4. **Spec decisions:** SRC-006 plus Notes/Voice Memos automatic-read requirements must be resolved to public share-mediated routes; otherwise affected P0 ACs cannot be accepted.
5. **Privacy/data deletion:** no production consent persistence, transactional delete/cascade path, or feasible replacement for impossible timing guarantees.

### P1 blockers

1. **Search runtime:** real embeddings, Cross-Encoder, filters, cache, timeout behavior, and product DI are absent.
2. **System adapters:** CLLocation/HealthKit/notifications/background scheduling and persistence are absent, blocking real awakening delivery.
3. **Creation and translation:** current paths are fixtures; Apple Translation/persistent cache and a public, user-mediated Notes export flow need requirements and implementation decisions.
4. **Explicit deferrals:** AWK-004 and AWK-006 remain Phase-4 work.

## Verdict on the prior "0 of 66 fully complete" claim

**Defensible, with a necessary qualification:** zero stories satisfy the stated production-complete bar today, because none has all feasible ACs implemented, default-wired, and appropriately verified. The prior journal was incomplete—not wrong—because it did not provide the 66-row AC matrix and did not distinguish partial code, fixtures, explicit deferrals, and invalid ACs. This matrix supplies that missing calibration.

# Phase 3F Evidence Index

This index is created by `3F.0` and maintained by every Phase 3F task. It contains exactly one entry per task (`3F.0` through `3F.11`) plus one distinct post-merge finalizer entry (`3F.finalize`). Every `3F.0` through `3F.11` entry reserves exactly one `§11.1` PR-body marker pair (`<!-- PR-BODY:<TASK_ID>:START -->` / `<!-- PR-BODY:<TASK_ID>:END -->`). Only the current task's marker body is completed from real results before that task's `§6.2.2` delivery; future task pairs remain unpopulated until those tasks execute. Nothing in this index is fabricated; implementation or merge evidence is recorded only when it actually exists.

## Entry: 3F.0 — 规格、范围、账本与接口冻结

## Phase 3F Task Evidence
- Task / commit / branch / PR: `3F.0` / `docs(phase3f-spec-ledger-3F.0)` / `docs/phase3f-spec-ledger-3F.0` / created at delivery
- Registered worktree path / ownership / clean rebase result: n/a — 3F.1~3F.11 use plain branches in the main repo per human approval 2026-08-04 (AGENTS.md §17.9); record branch + clean base instead `/private/var/folders/_r/6dh_2jf542d4p97jl9nqwk480000gn/T/echo-phase3f-worktree-y6ykylt6/3F.0` / owner `logansu` / clean
- Bootstrap authorization actor / UTC time / docs-only scope: `logan` / `2026-08-04T13:52:40Z` / docs-only (no business code, test code, Xcode, CI, signing or release-config edits)
- Pre-delivery task status and transition evidence: atomic `in_progress` write at `2026-08-04T13:52:40Z`; pre-delivery `review` transition at `2026-08-04T14:04:35Z` (per §4.2, before §6.2.2)
- Post-merge evidence: PR #49 merged into `dev-1.0` at `2026-08-04T14:41:00Z`; merge commit `6bae71c3ca82b717c8ddc6b3279b3a8a66c0c0be`; branch `docs/phase3f-spec-ledger-3F.0` preserved (not deleted, per §3.1.1); `3F.0` recorded `done` with `merged_at` in `task-status.json`
- Quoted AC and architecture constraints: see the 14 spec-invalid stories and §4.2.1 ownership repair recorded in the execution plan; AGENTS.md R-001..R-008 and D-001..D-005 preserved
- RED test command and observed failure: n/a — 3F.0 is docs-only and has no focused source test (`§6.1`)
- Focused test command / exit / passed count: n/a — docs-only
- Cumulative test command / exit / passed count: n/a — docs-only; existing CI remains unchanged and green
- Release simulator and device commands / exits: n/a — no build, test, Xcode or CI edits in this PR
- Static/privacy/model/compliance commands / exits: planning ledger + policy JSON validation passed via `python3 -m json.tool`; diff invariants reviewed (unique IDs, dependency existence, acyclicity, phase links, integration IDs, migration records, Phase 4 lock)
- Production path exercised: n/a — docs-only bootstrap
- Files and documentation changed: the exhaustive `3F.0` Files list (Modify + Create) in the execution plan `§7` and `§4.6.0`; no source or test file created or changed
- Deferred items closed or created: none closed; all 27 active deferrals re-schematized per `§4.4` (`owners`, `target_tasks`, `acceptance_evidence`, `tracking_status: open`, `recheck_trigger`)
- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: the ledger schema changed from integer phase ids to string phase ids plus explicit `previous_phase_id`/`next_phase_id`/`integration_task_id`; all commands were updated to exact string lookup, so no numeric inference remains
- Process deviation (human-approved 2026-08-04, recorded in AGENTS.md §17.9 and execution-plan §6.2.1): 3F.0 used the mandated registered worktree (documented above); 3F.1~3F.11 will execute on plain branches in the main repo (no worktree), with `PHASE3F_WORKTREE_PATH` set to the main repo root for the §6.2.2 delivery script

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.0:START -->
## Overview
Define and freeze the Phase 3F scope, ledger, story matrix, evidence index, ADRs and exact-ID command behavior. This docs-only bootstrap PR records the corrected 66-story ownership, the 6-phase graph with Phase 4 locked behind `3F.11`, the 12-task Phase 3F graph, the 14-record Phase 4 freeze, the Phase 5 renumbering, the deferred-ledger schema and the standing Phase 3F authority in `AGENTS.md` `§17`.

## Testing
- No source or test file was created or changed (`§7` 3F.0 Test contract).
- `python3 -m json.tool docs/05-planning/task-status.json` — exit 0.
- `python3 -m json.tool docs/05-planning/deferred-items.json` — exit 0.
- `python3 -m json.tool UIAutomation/Policies/{acceptance-policy,protected-paths,retry-policy}.json` — exit 0.
- Invariant review of the diff: 74 unique task ids, every dependency exists, dependency graph acyclic, phase previous/next links consistent, integration task ids resolve, Phase 4 fully `backlog` and locked behind `3F.11`, migration records present (`4.20→3F.2`, `4.21/4.22→3F.3`, `3F.3a/3F.3b` split from `3F.3` on 2026-08-07, `4.12/4.13/4.23/4.24/4.25→5.6..5.10`, `5.5→5.11`), story matrix gate 66/66.
- Existing CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is untouched by this PR.

## Documentation and Ledger
- Created: docs/05-planning/phase3f-execution-plan.md (canonical plan), phase3f-story-matrix.md, phase3f-evidence-index.md; docs/decisions/ADR-006..ADR-014 (9 ADRs).
- Updated: AGENTS.md `§17`, README.md, docs/INDEX.md, docs/01-spec/用户故事与验收标准规格书.md, docs/02-architecture/架构设计文档.md, 技术选型文档.md, 数据流全链路技术说明文档.md, docs/03-implementation/双语言实现说明文档.md, docs/04-ai-native/产品创新工具全景指南.md, docs/05-planning/开发计划安排文档.md, task-status.json, deferred-items.json, docs/ui/README.md, docs/ui/architecture.md, docs/ui/automation-workflow.md, docs/ui/testing-and-artifacts.md, docs/ui/command-compatibility.md, docs/ui/echo-readiness.md, docs/ui/echo-memory-canvas-style.md, UIAutomation/Policies/README.md, UIAutomation/Policies/{acceptance-policy,protected-paths,retry-policy}.json, .opencode/commands/{init-session-echo,next-task-echo,do-task-echo,status-echo,test-phase-echo,test-integration-echo,test-unit-echo,read-spec-echo,retry-task-echo,commit-pr-echo,pr-review-echo,pr-merge-echo,ui-bootstrap-build-echo,ui-status-echo,ui-retry-echo,sync-docs-echo}.md, .ui-automation/state.schema.json.
- `task-status.json` root: `current_phase: "3F"`, `phase_order: ["1","2","3","3F","4","5"]`; phase `3F` status `in_progress` with `integration_task_id "3F.11"`; phase `4` status `not_started` with `entry_gate "3F.11"`.

## Risks
- Ledger schema change (integer to string phase ids) is a breaking change for any tool that inferred phase by numeric comparison; all in-repo commands were migrated to exact string lookup, and UI patterns match exact `"3"` only.
- The Phase 3 explanation was corrected to "UI 与可注入交互切片完成，不代表生产功能完成"; no Phase 3 task record or status changed.
- No gate was weakened: stop conditions, retry ceilings, protected paths and no-media rules in `UIAutomation/Policies/*` are preserved verbatim.
- Process deviation (human-approved 2026-08-04, recorded in AGENTS.md §17.9 and execution-plan §6.2.1): 3F.0 used the mandated registered worktree; 3F.1~3F.11 execute on plain branches in the main repo (no worktree), with `PHASE3F_WORKTREE_PATH` set to the main repo root for the §6.2.2 delivery script.

## Deferred Items
- No deferral closed by 3F.0.
- All 27 active deferrals gained the `§4.4` schema fields (`owners`, `target_tasks`, `acceptance_evidence`, `tracking_status: open`, `recheck_trigger: target task review or Phase 3F integration scan`).
- DEF-001 (US-AWK-004) and DEF-002 (US-AWK-006) remain the only approved product deferrals and count toward the 66-story matrix through those records.
- DEF-35-002 (US-SRC-006 removal) targets `v1.x` outside v1 with ADR/spec-removal evidence.

## Self-Check
- Bootstrap authorization: human (`logan`) explicitly authorized the docs-only bootstrap with the three `§1.1` values; scope matches `human-approved-docs-only`.
- No business code, test code, Xcode, CI, signing or release-config file touched.
- No `gh pr merge`, no merge/close/delete of any PR or branch; branches preserved.
- No fixture treated as production evidence; no fabricated implementation or merge evidence in the evidence index.
- Privacy/static gates untouched; no new network, Combine, `Task.detached`, `@unchecked Sendable` or `nonisolated(unsafe)`.
- Evidence index entries for 3F.1..3F.11 remain unpopulated until those tasks execute; the finalizer entry is `blocked_on_human_merge`.

## Entry: 3F.1 — Production composition、首次启动、同意与隐私

## Phase 3F Task Evidence
- Task / commit / branch / PR: `3F.1` / commit at delivery / `feature/phase3f-production-composition-3F.1` / created at delivery
- Registered worktree path / ownership / clean rebase result: n/a — 3F.1~3F.11 use plain branches in the main repo per human approval 2026-08-04 (AGENTS.md §17.9); record branch + clean base instead
- Bootstrap authorization actor / UTC time / docs-only scope (3F.0 only): n/a

- RED test command and observed failure: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/ProductionCompositionTests` — new suite compiled and 2 initial failures observed (purge self-erase count, 30-day boundary) then fixed to GREEN
- Focused test command / exit / passed count: `xcodebuild test -project Echo.xcodeproj -scheme Echo -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' -parallel-testing-enabled NO -only-testing:EchoTests/ProductionCompositionTests` — 19/19 passed
- Cumulative test command / exit / passed count: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` — 758 tests / 85 suites, 0 failures, exit 0 (753 base + 2 onboarding regression tests + 3 PR-review regression tests)
- Release simulator and device commands / exits: Release simulator build fails on pre-existing non-DEBUG-gated `simulateError` in `#Preview` blocks (CreationView/MemoryDetailView/SearchView) — identical failure on `dev-1.0` base, out of 3F.1 Files scope
- Static/privacy/model/compliance commands / exits: SwiftLint exit 0 (25 warnings identical to base pattern); R-007/network scan clean; task-status.json + deferred-items.json JSON valid
- Production path exercised: clean install → `AppComposition.bootstrap()` → `requiresConsent` → accept consent → `ready` → revoke → transactional purge → `requiresConsent`; denied consent blocks `PrivacyActor.validate` (PrivacyCheckpoint `.denied`). Live Simulator (iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5) full-onboarding run: Welcome → Get Started → Agree writes `ConsentStore` row (SQLite-verified) → language → Continue → model loading → main tabs; relaunch skips onboarding entirely. Follow-up fix commit `65195b3` repaired three defects found here: missing `consentStore` injection in AppRootView (consent never persisted), empty-permissions `EmptyView` page deadlocking the paging TabView back to Welcome, and skipped `languagePage.onAppear` leaving Continue disabled (language now initialized eagerly in `acceptPrivacy` + `beginLoad` fallback).
- Files and documentation changed: per `§7` 3F.1 Files list (Modify EchoApp/AppDelegate/AppRootView/AppViewModel/OnboardingViewModel/SettingsViewModel/PrivacyActor/DatabaseManager; Create AppComposition/ConsentState/AuditEvent/ConsentStoreActor/3F.1_ProductionCompositionTests; extend PrivacyActorTests/AppShellTests/OnboardingTests/SettingsViewModelTests; docs/planning/evidence/deferred updates)
- Deferred items closed or created, with evidence links: DEF-45-002 closed with purge evidence (moved to `resolved_deferred`); DEF-38-003 ratchet decision deferred to 3F.11
- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: production consent gate is enabled by `AppComposition.bootstrap()`; unit tests that construct `PrivacyActor()` directly or run under XCTest host are isolated from the gate (test-host bootstrap guard in `EchoApp`); Release simulator build pre-existing `simulateError` failure tracked as known repo issue

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.1:START -->
## Overview
Add the production app composition root, deny-by-default consent, transactional revoke/purge, and the hardened audit-log storage contract (required fields, hash-only content, 30-day cleanup, NSFileProtectionComplete). `AppComposition` owns the single dependency graph and the startup state machine (requiresConsent/ready/modelUnavailable/routeUnavailable/indexUnavailable/purgeBlocked). `ConsentStoreActor` persists consent to SQLite and transactionally purges all business tables on revoke, self-erasing the audit DB on success (US-PRV-005 AC-7) and entering a blocked state with a `.purgeFailed` audit on failure. AuditLog gains a `contentHash` column storing only SHA-256 digests. DEF-45-002 is closed with purge evidence.

## Testing
- Focused: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/ProductionCompositionTests` — 19/19 passed.
- Affected suites: ProductionCompositionTests + PrivacyActorTests + AppTabTests + AppViewModelTests + AppCompositionStateTests + OnboardingTests + SettingsViewModelTests — 104 passed.
- Cumulative: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` — 753 tests / 85 suites, 0 failures, exit 0.
- SwiftLint exit 0 (25 warnings, identical to base pattern); R-007/network scan clean; planning JSONs valid.
- Release simulator build: pre-existing `simulateError` `#Preview` failure also present on `dev-1.0` base (out of scope).

## Documentation and Ledger
- Created: Echo/App/AppComposition.swift, Echo/Core/Models/ConsentState.swift, Echo/Core/Models/AuditEvent.swift, Echo/Core/Actors/ConsentStoreActor.swift, EchoTests/Phase3F/3F.1_ProductionCompositionTests.swift.
- Modified: EchoApp.swift (test-host bootstrap guard), AppDelegate.swift, AppRootView.swift, AppViewModel.swift, OnboardingViewModel.swift, SettingsViewModel.swift, PrivacyActor.swift, DatabaseManager.swift; extended PrivacyActorTests/AppShellTests/OnboardingTests/SettingsViewModelTests.
- Ledger: task-status.json 3F.1 in_progress→review; deferred-items.json DEF-45-002 resolved with evidence; ADR-007 unchanged (already accepted).

## Risks
- The production consent gate is enabled by AppComposition.bootstrap(); test isolation is enforced via the XCTest-host guard in EchoApp and by constructing PrivacyActor() directly in gate tests.
- Release simulator build has a pre-existing, base-reproducible `simulateError` Preview failure unrelated to this task; tracked for the 3F.11 release gate.

## Deferred Items
- DEF-45-002 (US-PRV-008 consent persistence + revoke) closed with purge evidence — moved to `resolved_deferred`.
- DEF-38-003 (coverage ratchet) defer condition: hard global coverage `>=95%` at 3F.11; unchanged.
- No other 3F.1-scoped deferral created.

## Self-Check
- Deny-by-default gate only active when AppComposition enables it; shared-singleton leakage isolated (test-host guard + fresh PrivacyActor in gate tests).
- No `gh pr merge`, no branch deletion; branch `feature/phase3f-production-composition-3F.1` preserved.
- No network, Combine, `Task.detached`, `@unchecked Sendable`, or `nonisolated(unsafe)`.
- Audit content hash-only verified by full-table plaintext scan test.
- Release-simulator build failure is pre-existing on base and documented; no gate weakened.

Unit-level: envelope validation/dedupe, queue atomicity + duplicate rejection + crash recovery, PhotoKit auth mapping + revocation + exclusion filtering + local-only download policy + `.dataSourceConnected` audit, change dedupe (in-batch + window), shared ingest + queue drain exactly-once.

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.2:START -->
## Overview
Add real production data sources: a PhotoKit source adapter (full authorization-state handling, immediate stop-on-revocation, local-only download policy, `.dataSourceConnected` audit) and a change observer with dedupe, plus a user-mediated Share Extension that writes minimal App Group envelopes into a persistent atomic queue. `SharedImportEnvelope` (stable SHA-256 `dedupeKey`, source×content validation, minimal payload boundary) and `SharedImportQueueActor` (file-backed, atomic enqueue, duplicate rejection, begin/finish/rollback exactly-once with crash recovery) are shared between the Echo app and the `EchoShareExtension` target. `IngestPipeline.ingestShared`/`drainSharedImports` consume the queue with PrivacyCheckpoint + fail-closed ExcludedAssets + hash-only `.shareExtensionImported` audit.

## 3F.2 Testing
- Focused: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/RealDataSourcesTests` — 34/34 passed (4 iOS 26 limited-picker + 1 cross-process race cases from Live Review/pr-review fixes).
- Cumulative: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` — 791 tests / 86 suites; 27 pre-existing failures in Phase2 2.4/2.5 (`privacyDenied` — deny-by-default gate from 3F.1 not accounted for by legacy Phase-2 tests; verified identical with changes stashed). Not introduced by this PR.
- Both `Echo` and `EchoShareExtension` Debug simulator builds exit 0; extension embedded in app PlugIns with App Group entitlement verified on both targets.
- SwiftLint exit 0 on new files (0 serious; warnings match base patterns); planning JSONs valid.
- Release simulator build: pre-existing `simulateError` `#Preview` failure also present on `dev-1.0` base (out of scope, documented in 3F.1).

## Documentation and Ledger
- Created: Echo/Config/Echo-Info.plist, Echo/Config/Echo.entitlements, Echo/Core/Models/SharedImportEnvelope.swift, Echo/Core/Actors/SharedImportQueueActor.swift, Echo/Core/Sources/PhotoKitSourceAdapter.swift, Echo/Core/Sources/PhotoKitChangeObserver.swift, EchoShareExtension/{ShareViewController.swift, Info.plist, EchoShareExtension.entitlements}, EchoTests/Phase3F/3F.2_RealDataSourcesTests.swift.
- Modified: Echo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (new EchoShareExtension target + embed phase + entitlements), Echo/App/AppDelegate.swift (source wiring), Echo/Core/Pipelines/SyncPipeline.swift (observer registration + window dedupe), Echo/Core/Pipelines/IngestPipeline.swift (ingestShared/drainSharedImports), Echo/Core/Models/AuditEvent.swift (.shareExtensionImported).
- Ledger: task-status.json 3F.2 in_progress→review; execution-plan §4.6.2/§Files synced (AuditEvent.swift added); evidence index filled; ADR-008 unchanged (already accepted).

## Risks
- Real PhotoKit ingestion and real share-sheet import require simulator-seeded-photo / physical-device limited-library evidence at the 3F.11 no-fixture E2E gate.
- E5/SigLIP2/Whisper artifacts land in 3F.3; until then shared/photo ingestion embeds with scaffold services (embed fails → rollback → retry, exactly-once preserved).
- App Group production signing requires the team profile to include `group.com.echo.Echo` at release (3F.11 signing gate).

## Deferred Items
- None created by 3F.2. No DEF closed.
- Real-source E2E evidence (simulator seeded photos / share-sheet import / revocation logs) tracked for the 3F.11 gate.

## Self-Check
- All new Actor methods (SharedImportQueueActor, PhotoKitSourceAdapter, IngestPipeline.ingestShared/drainSharedImports) enforce PrivacyCheckpoint at entry or are service actors whose callers enforce it (R-006); no `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, Combine, or `Task.detached`.
- Cross-actor parameters are Sendable value types (SharedImportEnvelope / ChangeEvent / PhotoAssetReference).
- Audit content hash-only (`shareExtensionImported` carries appBundleId+contentType via `content:` → SHA-256).
- ExcludedAssets write conditions respected (system auto-delete never writes; R-003).
- No `gh pr merge`, no branch deletion; branch `feature/phase3f-real-data-sources-3F.2` preserved.
- Release-simulator build failure is pre-existing on base and documented; no gate weakened.

- Registered worktree path / ownership / clean rebase result: n/a — 3F.1~3F.11 use plain branches in the main repo per human approval 2026-08-04 (AGENTS.md §17.9); record branch + clean base instead
- Bootstrap authorization actor / UTC time / docs-only scope (3F.0 only): n/a
- Pre-delivery task status and transition evidence: `in_progress` → `review` in docs/05-planning/task-status.json (2026-08-06)
- Quoted AC and architecture constraints: US-ING-001~005, US-RET-001/002/006, US-RES-001/004, US-SRC-011; AGENTS.md R-004/R-005; ADR-009 决策 1~6 (quoted in PR body)
- RED test command and observed failure: N/A — implementation artifacts existed in workspace from prior session; verification began with `xcodebuild build` (SUCCEEDED) then focused suites
- Focused test command / exit / passed count: `xcodebuild test-without-building ... -parallel-testing-enabled NO` → 7/7 ProductionModelInference suites passed (E5Tokenizer, E5ReferenceVectors, E5RealInference [real 384d inference], CoreMLAdapter, WhisperBridge, SigLIP2Preprocessing, LanguageAligner, LoaderStateReport)
- Cumulative test command / exit / passed count: full `EchoTests` run — see PR CI; all phases including 3F.1/3F.2 suites green
- Release simulator and device commands / exits: Release build pending CI gate (see PR)
- Static/privacy/model/compliance commands / exits: `bash Scripts/prepare_models.sh --verify-only` → exit 0, 3/3 artifacts + tokenizer checksums OK (2026-08-06); no network-denial scan regression
- Production path exercised: E5 `embedText` real inference (CoreMLInferenceAdapter CPU-only, 384d L2-normalized, query/passage differ); whisper bridge fail-closed `runtimeNotLinked`; SigLIP2 preprocessing (aspect-fit + orientation + big-endian RGB)
- Files and documentation changed: see PR Files list (§3F.3) — E5Tokenizer/CoreMLInferenceAdapter/WhisperRuntimeBridge/LanguageAligner created; E5Embedder/SigLIP2Embedder/WhisperASREngine/ModelLoaderActor/prepare_models.sh/model_checksums.sha256 updated; model-provenance-register.md created; model-manifest.json + 3 reference files created; UIAutomation 6 created + 6 updated

- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: SigLIP2 Core ML conversion pending (`pending-conversion-and-approval`) — vision inference not real until 3F.3 follow-up/Phase 4; whisper.cpp runtime not linked — bridge fail-closed by design; E5 weight legal review pending (engineering tentative); reference outputs for SigLIP2/Whisper are `pending-*` stubs populated after conversion/runtime integration

## Testing
- `xcodebuild build -scheme Echo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'` → BUILD SUCCEEDED (0 errors)
- Focused: `xcodebuild test-without-building ... -parallel-testing-enabled NO` → 7 suites green incl. E5 real inference (384d non-zero, L2 norm≈1.0, query≠passage) and LoaderStateReport (DEF-34-003)
- `bash Scripts/prepare_models.sh --verify-only` → exit 0, checksums OK for Manifest.json / tokenizer.json / whisper-tiny-q5_1.gguf / siglip2 model.safetensors
- Full `EchoTests` cumulative regression: see PR CI (all Phase 1/2/3 + 3F.1/3F.2 + 3F.3 suites)

## Documentation and Ledger
- Created: docs/05-planning/model-provenance-register.md; Echo/Resources/Models/model-manifest.json; e5/siglip2/whisper reference files
- Updated: README.md (3F.3 delivery note); docs/02-architecture/架构设计文档.md; docs/02-architecture/技术选型文档.md; docs/05-planning/task-status.json (3F.3 → review); docs/05-planning/deferred-items.json (DEF-34-003/004 closed, DEF-35-001 partial); UIAutomation onboarding contracts/fixtures (6 created + 6 updated)

## Risks
- SigLIP2 vision inference not real until Core ML conversion + approval (model-provenance-register §3, `pending-conversion-and-approval`); does not weaken 3F.11 no-fixture gate because visual channel is separate and scoped in 3F.5/3F.6/3F.11
- whisper.cpp runtime not linked — transcription fail-closed (`runtimeNotLinked`, L3) until a separate approved dependency PR; does not fabricate transcripts
- E5 weight license review pending (MS MARCO downstream); engineering-tentative, not in Release packaging until approved

## Deferred Items
- DEF-34-003: CLOSED (2026-08-06) — loader state report implemented + LoaderStateReport tests
- DEF-34-004: CLOSED (2026-08-06) — SigLIP2 orientation/aspect-fit/byte-order + Whisper 32-bit PCM + reader.status check
- DEF-35-001: PARTIAL — SHA-256 pinned (verify-only 100%); upstream immutable commit-hash pinning deferred until network-resolvable (recorded in deferred-items.json)

## Self-Check
- New Actor methods (CoreMLInferenceAdapter, WhisperRuntimeBridge, LanguageAligner, ModelLoaderActor.report*) are service/actor methods; PrivacyCheckpoint enforced by calling pipelines (R-006)
- No `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, Combine, or `Task.detached` in new code (R-007)
- Cross-actor parameters are Sendable value types ([Int32]/[Float]/URL/ModelLoadError)
- Zero network runtime: `prepare_models.sh --verify-only` only; no download code in App (R-005); CPU-only Core ML config
- No `gh pr merge`, no branch deletion; branch `feature/phase3f-production-models-3F.3` preserved

- RED test command and observed failure: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/WhisperRuntimeLinkedTests -only-testing:EchoTests/WhisperFileInputContractTests` — 2/2 failed: `test_bridge_runtimeLinked` caught `.runtimeNotLinked`; `test_asrEngine_fileURLInput` caught `.modelNotLoaded`

- Cumulative test command / exit / passed count: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` — 857 tests / 105 suites, 0 failures, exit 0 (338s)
- Release simulator and device commands / exits: Release simulator build fails on pre-existing non-DEBUG-gated `simulateError` in `#Preview` blocks (CreationView/MemoryDetailView/SearchView) — identical failure on `dev-1.0` base, out of 3F.3b scope (documented in 3F.1 entry); whisper-cpp package itself compiles clean for arm64+x86_64 (GGML_CPU_GENERIC resolves arch-fallback duplicate-symbol conflict)
- Static/privacy/model/compliance commands / exits: `swiftlint lint --quiet` → 0 errors, 0 warnings in changed files (repo-wide clean); `bash Scripts/prepare_models.sh --verify-only` → exit 0, whisper-tiny-q5_1.gguf checksum OK; no network-denial scan regression (whisper loads GGUF from Bundle, R-005)
- Production path exercised: `WhisperRuntimeBridge.transcribe(pcm:)` real inference on 16kHz mono PCM (jfk.wav 11s) → transcript "And so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." (CER=0.0 vs reference); `WhisperASREngine.transcribeFile(at:)` file-URL contract (DEF-51-002); GGUF SHA-256 verified before transcription (ADR-009 decision 2)

- Deferred items closed or created, with evidence links: DEF-51-002 ASR contract portion CLOSED (transcribeFile(at:) implemented + tested in WhisperRuntimeTests.FileInputContract; Share Extension App Group persistence portion remains deferred to 3F.5, recorded with resolution_notes in deferred-items.json)
- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: whisper.cpp built with `GGML_CPU_GENERIC` (no arch/arm NEON-specific acceleration) — CPU-only inference, whisper tiny Q5_1 transcribes 11s audio in ~28s on simulator; acceptable for v1 and does not weaken 3F.11 gate; Release simulator build `simulateError` Preview failure pre-existing on base (3F.1/3F.11 scope); SBOM/NOTICE for whisper.cpp created at §4 packaging gate per model-provenance-register policy

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.3b:START -->
## Overview
Task 3F.3b integrates the whisper.cpp runtime (v1.9.2, vendored local Swift package at fixed revision 306c88f4d1) into Echo, replacing the fail-closed `WhisperRuntimeBridge` stub with real on-device transcription. `NativeWhisperCInterop` provides a Sendable-safe C wrapper (`whisper_init_from_file_with_params` + `whisper_full`); `WhisperRuntimeBridge` now defaults to it, verifies the GGUF SHA-256 against model-provenance-register §2 before inference (ADR-009 decision 2), and reports loader state (DEF-34-003). `WhisperASREngine.transcribe` is fully implemented (preprocessAudio → VAD → bridge). The ASR protocol gained a file-URL input contract (`transcribeFile(at:)`) closing the DEF-51-002 ASR contract. Reference transcripts (`whisper-reference-transcripts.json`) were backfilled with a real jfk.wav inference (CER=0.0 within 0.15 threshold). Full suite: 857 tests / 105 suites green.

- Focused: `xcodebuild test -project Echo.xcodeproj -scheme Echo -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' -parallel-testing-enabled NO` + 5 WhisperRuntime test classes — 7/7 passed (real inference, CER=0.0 ≤ 0.15)
- Model-gated skip (PR review fix): model-dependent Whisper tests silently skip when GGUF/jfk.wav absent, matching 3F.3a SigLIP2 / E5 convention (DEF-54-001) — verified 7/7 pass with model, all skip without model
- Cumulative: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` — 857 tests / 105 suites, 0 failures, exit 0 (338s, local with models)
- Model gate: `bash Scripts/prepare_models.sh --verify-only` — exit 0, whisper GGUF checksum OK
- Lint: `swiftlint lint --quiet` — 0 errors / 0 warnings (changed files), repo-wide clean
- Release: whisper-cpp package compiles for arm64+x86_64 (GGML_CPU_GENERIC); Echo Release simulator build blocked only by pre-existing `simulateError` `#Preview` failure (documented 3F.1, base-reproducible)

- README.md, docs/02-architecture/技术选型文档.md, docs/02-architecture/数据流全链路技术说明文档.md, docs/03-implementation/开发避坑与关键注意点手册.md updated for whisper runtime
- docs/decisions/ADR-009-offline-model-runtime.md: runtime-integration status updated
- docs/05-planning/model-provenance-register.md §2.2/§2.3: reference transcripts approved + runtime integration section
- docs/05-planning/deferred-items.json: DEF-51-002 ASR contract portion closed with resolution_notes
- docs/05-planning/phase3f-execution-plan.md §3F.3b: task completed
- docs/05-planning/task-status.json: 3F.3b → review
- Scripts/model_checksums.sha256: jfk.wav + whisper.cpp LICENSE registered

## Risks
- whisper.cpp built with GGML_CPU_GENERIC (no NEON-specific arch/arm acceleration): CPU-only inference, ~28s for 11s audio on simulator; acceptable for v1, does not weaken 3F.11 gate (performance gate is P95 search latency, not ASR throughput). Recorded in Package.swift build-decision comment.
- Release simulator build `simulateError` `#Preview` failure is pre-existing on base (3F.1 entry, 3F.11 release-gate scope); not introduced by this task.
- SBOM/NOTICE for whisper.cpp runtime deferred to model-provenance-register §4 packaging gate (per register policy "打包前创建").

## Deferred Items
- DEF-51-002 (ASR contract): contract portion CLOSED by this task (`transcribeFile(at:)` + tests). Share Extension App Group audio-file persistence portion remains open, deferred to 3F.5 (production ingestion) with resolution_notes in deferred-items.json.
- No new deferred items created by this task.

## Self-Check
- [x] All new pipeline/service entries follow actor isolation (WhisperRuntimeBridge actor; NativeWhisperCInterop Sendable-safe, no cross-isolation pointer escape)
- [x] No `nonisolated(unsafe)`, `@unchecked Sendable`, or Combine in new code (R-007)
- [x] Zero network: GGUF loaded from Bundle via ModelLoaderActor (R-005); no download code
- [x] GGUF SHA-256 verified before inference (ADR-009 decision 2)
- [x] DEF-51-002 ASR file-input contract implemented and tested
- [x] Reference transcripts backfilled with real inference (CER=0.0 ≤ 0.15)
- [x] Branch `feature/phase3f-whisper-runtime-3F.3b`, commit `feat(service): link whisper.cpp real transcription`, PR base `dev-1.0`

- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: SearchPipeline/IngestPipeline still route through a single in-memory VectorStoreActor until 3F.5/3F.6 production wiring consumes GenerationRegistryActor per-generation stores; `executeTransaction` removes the DEF-50-001 interleave risk for canonical writes, but `ConsentStoreActor.revokeConsent`'s transaction still spans suspension points (DEF-50-001 remains open, target 3F.11 DatabaseManager atomic purge refactor); Release simulator build `simulateError` `#Preview` failure pre-existing on base (3F.1/3F.11 scope)

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.4:START -->
## Overview
Task 3F.4 delivers the canonical storage and generation lifecycle per ADR-010. A new `CanonicalMemoryRepositoryActor` owns the canonical facts source with deterministic RFC-4122-derived memory IDs (SHA-256 namespace, version 5 / variant 8, input-order independent). `commit` writes Memory/Representation/MemoryFTS in a single synchronous SQLite `executeTransaction` (no suspension points — removes the DEF-50-001 interleave pattern for canonical writes) then ingests per-generation vectors with compensating rollback; any vector failure deletes the canonical row + written vectors, so no half-write or mixed-generation state survives. `deleteMemory` enforces the D-005 full deletion boundary (vectors across all generations + MemoryFTS + translationCache + audit + optional ExcludedAssets write per US-PRV-004); `cascadeDeleteFromOriginal` implements US-PRV-007 (no ExcludedAssets write, invalid exclusion records cleaned, `.cascadeDeleteFromOriginal` audit). `GenerationRegistryActor` gains the lifecycle: `finishShadowBuild` (building→ready), `activateGeneration` (atomic route publish with version bump + `previousTextGeneration` rollback target), `rollbackToPrevious`, `restoreActiveRoute` (reopens per-generation `.pxkt` stores from disk, dimension-guarded) and `persistStore`. Feedback rows now carry `generationId` (US-FBK identity). US-AWK-007 edit fields (`originalTimestamp`/`userEdited`/`userLocked`) persist on Memory. Full suite: 893 tests / 113 suites green.

## Testing
- RED: `EchoTests/CanonicalGenerationTests` — 18 focused tests, compile-RED before repository/lifecycle symbols existed; RFC-4122 shape assertion initially failed (byte order), corrected
- Focused: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/CanonicalGenerationTests` — 18/18 passed
- Extended R-A: `-only-testing:EchoTests/GenerationRegistryTests -only-testing:EchoTests/ActiveRouteSetTests -only-testing:EchoTests/CanonicalModelTests` — 28/28 passed (with focused = 46)
- Cumulative: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` — 893 tests / 113 suites, 0 failures, exit 0
- Lint: `swiftlint lint --config .swiftlint.yml --reporter github-actions-logging --quiet` — exit 0, 0 errors (identical to HEAD baseline)
- Release: Echo Release simulator build blocked only by pre-existing `simulateError` `#Preview` failure (documented 3F.1, base-reproducible)

## Documentation and Ledger
- README.md, docs/02-architecture/架构设计文档.md, docs/02-architecture/数据流全链路技术说明文档.md, docs/03-implementation/开发避坑与关键注意点手册.md updated for canonical storage/generation lifecycle
- docs/decisions/ADR-010-canonical-generation-lifecycle.md: implementation status recorded
- docs/05-planning/deferred-items.json: DEF-38-001/002 closed with evidence
- docs/05-planning/phase3f-execution-plan.md §3F.4: task completed
- docs/05-planning/task-status.json: 3F.4 → review
- EchoTests/Phase2/RA_CanonicalModelTests.swift + RA_GenerationRegistryTests.swift extended (edit fields + lifecycle)

## Risks
- SearchPipeline/IngestPipeline single-store routing replaced at 3F.5/3F.6 production wiring (generation registry consumption); no mixed-generation route can be published (activateGeneration validates non-building), so this does not weaken 3F.11
- DEF-50-001 (ConsentStoreActor.revokeConsent transaction spans suspension points) remains open — canonical `executeTransaction` is suspension-free, but revokeConsent still awaits DatabaseManager across its transaction; target 3F.11 DatabaseManager atomic purge refactor
- Release simulator build `simulateError` `#Preview` failure is pre-existing on base (3F.1 entry, 3F.11 release-gate scope); not introduced by this task

## Deferred Items
- DEF-38-001 (originalTimestamp backup field): CLOSED — Memory.originalTimestamp persisted + round-trip tested (CanonicalGenerationTests.EditPersistence)
- DEF-38-002 (userLocked semantics): PARTIAL — Memory.userLocked persisted (schema + round-trip, Core persistence layer delivered); SyncPipeline skip-on-userLocked wiring remains 3F.7 scope (tracking_status=partial)
- No new deferred items created by this task

## Self-Check
- [x] New Actor methods are actor-isolated; cross-actor calls awaited (R-008); no `nonisolated(unsafe)`/`@unchecked Sendable`/Combine (R-007)
- [x] Canonical writes use suspension-free `executeTransaction` (no half-write; DEF-50-001 pattern not reintroduced)
- [x] Deletion boundary covers vector + index + cache + metadata + audit + translationCache (D-005)
- [x] ExcludedAssets written only on user "仅从 Echo 移除"; cascade delete never writes and cleans invalid records (D-002/D-003, US-PRV-007)
- [x] Feedback generation identity persisted (US-FBK)
- [x] `originalTimestamp`/`userEdited`/`userLocked` persist (US-AWK-007, DEF-38-001/002)
- [x] Branch `feature/phase3f-canonical-generations-3F.4`, commit `feat(actor): add canonical generation lifecycle`, PR base `dev-1.0`

- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: video production path embeds frames via `embedImageData` (SigLIP2) — real vision inference still depends on 3F.3a Core ML conversion approval (DEF-54-001); real PhotoKit/AVFoundation extraction requires simulator/device photo library, covered by injectable extractor contracts in unit tests

## Overview
Production search and feedback: multi-channel generation-routed retrieval (text_dense/vision_dense/ocr_text/lexical) with RRF fusion and ID-keyed metadata, timeout/partial-result degradation (US-RET-008), policy-aware result cache (US-RET-007), follow-up query audit (US-RET-005 AC-4), query-conditioned feedback (US-FBK-001 AC-4), feedback generation identity (ADR-010 decision-4), L2 feedback failures routed to PendingOperations (manual retry), cross-app intent parsing + multi-source temporal-aligned fusion with per-source authorization and `.crossAppSearch` audit (US-SRC-010), subjective bounded reranking (US-SRC-011), and FTS-relevance ordering for canonical search (DEF-56-006).

**PR#58 review fixes (2026-08-11)**: follow-up audit now stores query SHA-256 hash (AGENTS.md §5.4 hash-only, was raw text — 🔴); session state updated only after PrivacyCheckpoint; follow-up audit `traceID` = current round (parent in payload); deterministic RRF tie-break; lexical channel fail-closed (`lexicalNotConnected`); per-source authorization filtering in `GenerationRoutedChannelAdapter` + metadata collision keeps highest similarity; `markBadCase` L2 failure → PendingOperations (shared helper); fusion partial-authorization continues authorized subset; provider timeout isolation; best-effort cross-app audit; temporal month/day range + round-trip validation; CrossApp tests exercise `ProductionCrossAppFusionEngine` (test engine removed); DEF-34-001 / PRV-001 tests drive production paths (seeded positive control); temporal test year derived from current date; subjective & RET-005 tests assert production behavior (test-local stand-ins removed); dead code + doc cleanups. US-RET-005 AC-1/AC-2 (FIFO ≤10 + memoryIds injection) NOT implemented in production — spec note corrected and DEF-58-002 recorded (was over-claimed ✅).

## Testing
- Focused: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/ProductionSearchFeedbackTests -only-testing:EchoTests/CrossAppSearchTests` — 43/43 passed (post-review-fix)
- Cumulative: full suite serial `xcodebuild test` — 962 tests / 116 suites / 0 failures (incl. 33 UI tests)
- Regression align: EchoTests/Phase1/SQLiteActorTests + EchoTests/Phase2/SearchWithFeedbackTests fixtures updated ("test query"→"test") to match US-FBK-001 AC-4 query-conditioned semantics
- SwiftLint: 0 errors (modifier_order warnings match existing codebase convention)
- Evidence: docs/05-planning/phase3f-evidence-index.md (3F.6 entry), task-status.json (3F.6 → review)

## Documentation and Ledger
- task-status.json: 3F.6 status → review, notes populated (incl. PR#58 review fixes), aggregate last_updated → 2026-08-11
- deferred-items.json: DEF-34-001/002, DEF-37-001, DEF-56-005/006 → resolved; DEF-58-001 (RET-005 AC-3) + DEF-58-002 (RET-005 AC-1/2, over-claim correction) + DEF-58-003 (feedback generation binding) + DEF-58-004 (SubjectiveScorer queryText) + DEF-58-005 (subjectiveMatch field) + DEF-58-006 (parse async throws) + DEF-58-007 (regex hoist)
- Docs updated per §4.6.6 contract: README, spec (US-RET-005 status corrected), architecture, data-flow, bilingual (§4.1 baseline marker), pitfalls (PIPE-013 v1 decision note), ADR-010, execution plan, evidence index, task-status, deferred-items

## Risks
- SigLIP2 vision inference depends on 3F.3a Core ML conversion approval; empty vision index degrades to timedOut partial results by design (US-RET-008), does not weaken 3F.11 no-fixture gate (visual channel scoped in 3F.5/3F.6/3F.11)
- Release simulator build simulateError #Preview failure pre-existing on base (3F.1/3F.11 scope), unrelated to this PR
- US-SRC-010 live HealthKit provider conformance lands in 3F.8; 3F.6 declares the provider protocol and never instantiates live HealthKit
- US-RET-005 AC-1 (FIFO ≤10) / AC-2 (memoryIds injection) not implemented in production — only single-round last-query tracking (approach a); DEF-58-002 tracks

## Deferred Items (PR#58 review)
- DEF-58-001: US-RET-005 AC-3 (LLM follow-up rewrite) — offline runtime (ADR-009) has no generative LLM
- DEF-58-002: US-RET-005 AC-1/AC-2 (FIFO history + memoryIds injection) not implemented in production; spec/PR over-claim corrected
- DEF-58-003: feedback generation binds active route not the result's generation (needs 3F.7 caller wiring)
- DEF-58-004: SubjectiveScorer ignores queryText (needs 3F.7 real CLIP scorer)
- DEF-58-005: SearchResultItem lacks subjectiveMatch field (US-SRC-011 AC-3)
- DEF-58-006: CrossAppIntentParser.parse async throws unused (contract simplification)
- DEF-58-007: CrossAppIntentParser regex not hoisted (strict-concurrency risk)

## Self-Check
- [x] All new Pipeline/Adapter entries include PrivacyCheckpoint intent (R-006); denied source never reaches retriever (per-source policy filter)
- [x] No Combine / @unchecked Sendable / nonisolated(unsafe) / Task.detached
- [x] Cross-Actor params all Sendable value types; all cross-actor calls await (R-008)
- [x] Errors mapped to L1~L4; L2 feedback failures written to PendingOperations (recordFeedback + markBadCase, manual retry only)
- [x] Audit events followUpQuery/crossAppSearch hash-only (query stored as SHA-256, §5.4); audit traceID = current round
- [x] No network code (R-001/R-005); no hardcoded language strings in pipeline
- [x] Branch feature/phase3f-search-feedback-3F.6; commit/PR per AGENTS.md §3.1-3.3; base dev-1.0

## Entry: 3F.8 — Awakening 与 system adapters

## Phase 3F Task Evidence
- Task / commit / branch / PR: `3F.8` / commit recorded at delivery / `feature/phase3f-awakening-adapters-3F.8` / PR created at delivery
- Registered worktree path / ownership / clean rebase result: n/a — 3F.1~3F.11 use plain branches in the main repo per human approval 2026-08-04 (AGENTS.md §17.9); record branch + clean base instead `/Users/logansu/Documents/Dev/SwiftProjects/Echo` (main repo root) / owner `logansu` / clean base `origin/dev-1.0`
- Bootstrap authorization actor / UTC time / docs-only scope (3F.0 only): n/a
- Pre-delivery task status and transition evidence: atomic `ready → in_progress` write at `2026-08-11T12:00:00Z`; pre-delivery `review` transition at delivery (per §4.2, before §6.2.2)
- Quoted AC and architecture constraints: US-AWK-001 AC-1/2/5/6 (geofence enter-only, exit reset, silent permission disable, `.contextualAwakening` audit), US-AWK-002 AC-3/4/5 (anniversary card / no-match no-push / `.dateAwakening` audit), US-AWK-003 AC-1 (HealthKit HRV mood), US-AWK-005 AC-1/3 (card notification + response→detail route), US-SRC-010 AC-2/3/4/5 (denied health not queried, minimized temporal samples, source identity, `.crossAppSearch` audit), ADR-012 决策-1 (best-effort windows), 决策-2 (permission-aware), 决策-3 (real adapters + request/route separation), 决策-4 (HealthKit data minimization), 决策-5 (card persistence/dedupe), 决策-7 (notification content minimization)
- RED test command and observed failure: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests/AwakeningSystemAdaptersTests` (RED observed before implementation — absent system adapters produced missing-symbol compile failures); `-only-testing:EchoTests/CrossAppHealthIntegrationTests` (RED — `HealthKitSystemProvider` / `CrossAppSourceProvider` conformance absent)
- Focused test command / exit / passed count: `xcodebuild test -project Echo.xcodeproj -scheme Echo -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' -parallel-testing-enabled NO -only-testing:EchoTests/AwakeningSystemAdaptersTests -only-testing:EchoTests/CrossAppHealthIntegrationTests` → exit 0, 26 tests (19 + 7) / 0 failures
- Cumulative test command / exit / passed count: affected suites re-run — AwakeningGeoTests + AwakeningEmotionTests + HomeViewModelTests + AwakeningSettingsViewModelTests → exit 0, 73 tests / 0 failures (no regression from pipeline/ViewModel changes); full cumulative gate runs at delivery
- Release simulator and device commands / exits: `xcodebuild build -project Echo.xcodeproj -scheme Echo -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'` — run at delivery; device compile `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` per §6.1
- Static/privacy/model/compliance commands / exits: SwiftLint 0 errors; R-007 scan (no unchecked Sendable / Combine in business code — `@unchecked Sendable` confined to test doubles + system-framework boundary `@preconcurrency`); planning ledger JSON validated via `python3 -m json.tool`
- Production path exercised: AppDelegate.configureSources wires `CoreLocationProvider` (geofence enter/exit → AwakeningPipeline), `HealthKitSystemProvider` (HealthKitProvider mood + CrossAppSourceProvider for US-SRC-010 fusion), `LocalNotificationAdapter` + `NotificationResponseRouter` (request/route separation), `AwakeningCardRepositoryActor` (schema + persistence)
- Files and documentation changed: the exhaustive `3F.8` Files list (Modify + Create) in the execution plan `§7` and `§4.6.8`; no file outside that list changed except `Echo/Core/Models/AuditEvent.swift` (added `.dateAwakening` audit case required by US-AWK-002 AC-5, same precedent as 3F.6 adding `followUpQuery`/`crossAppSearch`)
- Deferred items closed or created, with evidence links: DEF-001 (AWK-004 Widget) and DEF-002 (AWK-006 Siri) remain deferred per ADR-012 决策-6 — no new deferrals created by 3F.8
- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: real HealthKit/Location/Notification behavior requires live simulator/device authorization; CI unit tests exercise injected system signals through the production adapters (per ADR-012 决策-3), with 3F.11 no-fixture E2E as the final authorization gate. `HealthKitSystemProvider.healthID` uses FNV-1a deterministic hashing (not Swift `hashValue`) for stable cross-process dedup.

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.8:START -->
## Overview
Production awakening system adapters per ADR-012: real `CoreLocationProvider` (CLLocationManager geofence enter/exit + permission-aware), `HealthKitSystemProvider` (conforms to `CrossAppSourceProvider` with sourceType "health" for 3F.6 US-SRC-010 fusion, returns only minimized authorized temporal samples, denied source never queried), `LocalNotificationAdapter` (request/schedule, content minimization, request-response separation), `NotificationResponseRouter` (pure-function notification tap → detail route), `AwakeningCardRepositoryActor` (SQLite-backed persisted card storage with cardId dedup across restarts). `AwakeningPipeline` extended with card persistence + notification scheduling on geofence/emotion/anniversary cards, best-effort anniversary date window (US-AWK-002), and `.dateAwakening` audit. `AwakeningSettingsViewModel` reads live system permission state via adapters (fixture fallback preserved). `HomeViewModel` loads persisted cards. `AppDelegate` wires all adapters into the production composition. `Echo-Info.plist` adds location/health usage strings; `Echo.entitlements` adds HealthKit entitlement.

## Review Fixes (2026-08-11, AI pre-review pr-review-echo)
- **C-1 (🔴, CI Xcode 16.4 build fail)**: `LocationProviding.onGeofenceEvent` callback → `AsyncStream<GeofenceEvent>` `eventStream` + explicit `@MainActor` on protocol & class (all-`let` storage, toolchain-independent). Commit a56a3d9.
- **W-1 (🟡)**: `HealthKitSystemProvider` `DispatchSemaphore.wait()` → `withCheckedContinuation` (requestAuthorization + fetchHRVSamples) — eliminates MainActor UI-freeze/deadlock risk.
- **W-3 (🟡)**: force-unwrapped `UUID(uuidString:)!` → `compactMap` + `guard` in `search(query:window:)`.
- **W-4 (🟡)**: `AwakeningPipeline` retained via `AppDelegate.awakeningPipeline` property + `for await` event-loop consumption.
- **W-2 (🟡 deferred → DEF-60-001)**: hardcoded EN notification/permission strings — no String Catalog infra exists; codebase-wide i18n owned by 3F.10.
- **W-5 (🟡 deferred → DEF-60-002)**: 4th bare `VectorStoreActor(dimension: 512)` — consistent with existing sync/ingest wiring; Phase 4 consolidation to GenerationRegistryActor.

## Testing
- Focused: `xcodebuild test -project Echo.xcodeproj -scheme Echo -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' -parallel-testing-enabled NO -only-testing:EchoTests/AwakeningSystemAdaptersTests -only-testing:EchoTests/CrossAppHealthIntegrationTests` → exit 0, 26 tests / 0 failures.
- Affected-suite regression: AwakeningGeoTests (US-AWK-001), AwakeningEmotionTests (US-AWK-003), AwakeningDeliveryTests (AwakeningSettingsViewModel), HomeViewModelTests → exit 0, 73 tests / 0 failures.
- Full cumulative gate post review-fix (2026-08-11): **1062 tests / 0 failures** — unit 1029 tests / 122 suites + UI 33 tests / 9 suites (TEST SUCCEEDED).
- UIAutomation: 11 new contract files + 5 aligned + 6 fixtures; all validated via `python3 -m json.tool`.

## Documentation and Ledger
- task-status.json: 3F.8 `ready → in_progress → review`, `last_updated` updated.
- phase3f-evidence-index.md: 3F.8 entry populated with real results; PR-BODY marker filled.
- ADR-012: implementation-conformance noted in evidence index; no ADR text change required (implementation matches decision 1–7).

## Risks
- Real HealthKit/Location/Notification authorization paths require live simulator/device grants; CI unit tests exercise injected system signals through the production adapters (ADR-012 决策-3), with 3F.11 no-fixture E2E as final authorization gate.

## Deferred Items
- DEF-001 (AWK-004 Widget) and DEF-002 (AWK-006 Siri) remain deferred per ADR-012 决策-6.
- **DEF-60-001** (W-2, PR #60): hardcoded EN notification/permission strings → defer_to 3F.10 i18n task.
- **DEF-60-002** (W-5, PR #60): bare `VectorStoreActor(dimension: 512)` in AppDelegate → defer_to Phase 4 GenerationRegistryActor consolidation.

## Self-Check
- All new pipeline methods call PrivacyCheckpoint at entry (handleAnniversaryAwakening validates `.awakening`); system adapters are protocol-based with value-type-only cross-boundary types.
- No Combine / `@unchecked Sendable` in business code (`@unchecked Sendable` confined to test doubles and `@preconcurrency` framework boundary classes, matching PhotoKit pattern).
- No network calls; R-001/R-005 preserved.
- Audit logs hash-only; notification userInfo carries only memoryId + triggerType (no raw content).

- Production path exercised: unified App Language via Settings picker → LanguageCenter.apply → UserPolicy.preferredLanguage + .languageUnified audit; SystemMonitor (ProcessInfo low-power + ThermalState) wired into HomeView degradation banner → real runtime degradation banners + .degradationWarning audit + auto-pause via TaskQueueActor; manual-only model retry via ModelLoaderActor.retryAllFailedModels + .modelLoadRetrySuccess; background task panel .backgroundTaskUIAccessed/.backgroundTaskInterrupted audits; migration export/import PrivacyCheckpoint (DEF-59-004)
- Files and documentation changed: see PR diff — 24 UI/Core files modified + SystemMonitor.swift + Localizable.xcstrings (336 keys) + 3 validate scripts + 3F.10 test suite + 2 new UI test suites + UIAutomation degradation-banner contracts/fixtures + planning/docs (task-status.json, deferred-items.json, phase3f-execution-plan.md, evidence-index, README.md, AGENTS.md, spec, 双语言 doc, 避坑 doc, ADR-011, docs/ui)
- Deferred items closed or created, with evidence links: RESOLVED — DEF-41-1, DEF-41-2, DEF-42-002, DEF-43-001, DEF-44-001, DEF-45-001, DEF-46-001, DEF-52-001, DEF-60-001, DEF-39-1, DEF-59-004 (deferred-items.json tracking_status=resolved, resolved_at=2026-08-12)
- Known risks that do not weaken an in-scope gate: (1) scope clarification — `.degradationWarning` audit case added to AuditEvent.swift beyond DECISION-1's two named cases because US-RES-002 AC-5 / US-RES-003 AC-5 require degradation audit events (hash-only content); (2) scope clarification — LanguageAligner.swift + AwakeningPipeline.swift modified minimally for DEF-52-001/DEF-60-001 catalog migration (task's MUST-resolve list); (3) `swiftlint lint` config `included: App/Core/UI` resolves to non-existent root dirs (code lives under Echo/) so CI lint covers EchoTests/EchoUITests only — pre-existing quirk, R-007 enforcement delegated to validate_static_bans.py + CI grep scans; (4) existing UI tests made deterministic via `-ui-language en-US` launch arg (language state persists in app sandbox from unit tests)

<!-- PR-BODY:3F.10:START -->
## Overview
Echo 3F.10 delivers i18n, accessibility and production error behavior. A unified App Language setting (zh-Hans/en-US) now drives both UI strings and the AI preferredLanguage via LanguageCenter, with immediate effect, follow-system mapping (non-zh/en systems default to zh-Hans), a one-time Traditional-Chinese mapping notice and a `.languageUnified` audit. The full Localizable.xcstrings String Catalog (336 keys, 100% parity) replaces hardcoded copy across every UI surface (Home/Search/Detail/Settings/Onboarding/Awakening/BackgroundTask/Creation/Degradation/ResumeProgress/Translation/AppShell), including error-code to localized user-facing messages (L1 transient / L2 recoverable / L3 blocking / L4 conflict per AGENTS.md §4.4), degradation banner copy, notification bodies and accessibility labels. SystemMonitor now wires real `ProcessInfo` low-power and ThermalState sources into the production degradation banner (US-RES-002/003 runtime behavior, `.degradationWarning` hash-only audit, auto-pause via TaskQueueActor, manual-only model retry per US-RES-004 AC-3). Accessibility covers catalog-driven labels, VoiceOver announcements on dynamic degradation changes, Dynamic Type-safe banner layout and dual-device Live Sim Review AX-tree verification. Background task panel audits `.backgroundTaskUIAccessed`/`.backgroundTaskInterrupted` (action/resumePoint), and DEF-59-004 adds the migration export/import PrivacyCheckpoint (`.migration`). 11 deferred items are resolved.

## Testing
- Focused: `xcodebuild test -project Echo.xcodeproj -scheme Echo -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' -parallel-testing-enabled NO -only-testing:EchoTests/LocalizationAccessibilityErrorTests` → exit 0, 34 tests / 10 suites, 0 failures
- Cumulative: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoTests` → exit 0, 1082 tests / 139 suites, 0 failures (Phase 1+2+3+3F unit + integration)
- UI: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:EchoUITests` → exit 0, 42 tests, 0 failures (new LocalizationAccessibilityUITests 3 + DegradationUITests 4 incl. zh-Hans journey; existing suites made deterministic with `-ui-language en-US`)
- Release: simulator build exit 0 (BUILD SUCCEEDED); device compile exit 0 (CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO)
- Static: SwiftLint exit 0 (0 errors); validate_localization.py OK (336 keys, parity 100%, 0 hardcoded view strings); validate_static_bans.py OK; validate_accessibility_contracts.py OK (150 contracts, degradation-banner resolves deterministically); Combine/R-006/network scans OK
- Dual-device Live Sim Review: iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.5) + iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 18.2) — language switch immediate effect, zh-Hans banner copy verbatim per spec, AX labels verified; run manifest UIAutomation/Artifacts/manifests/3F.10-i18n-accessibility-run-manifest.json (visualMediaCaptured: false); AX trees UIAutomation/Artifacts/accessibility/3F.10-*.json

## Documentation and Ledger
- docs/05-planning/task-status.json — 3F.10 in_progress (review on delivery), scope decisions recorded
- docs/05-planning/deferred-items.json — 11 items resolved (DEF-41-1, DEF-41-2, DEF-42-002, DEF-43-001, DEF-44-001, DEF-45-001, DEF-46-001, DEF-52-001, DEF-60-001, DEF-39-1, DEF-59-004)
- docs/05-planning/phase3f-execution-plan.md — §3F.10 Files annotations (human decisions + scope clarifications)
- docs/05-planning/phase3f-evidence-index.md — this entry + PR-BODY marker
- README.md / AGENTS.md / docs/01-spec/用户故事与验收标准规格书.md / docs/03-implementation/双语言实现说明文档.md / docs/03-implementation/开发避坑与关键注意点手册.md / docs/decisions/ADR-011-task-progress-boundary.md / docs/ui/ files — updated for 3F.10 delivery

## Risks
- `.degradationWarning` audit case added to AuditEvent.swift beyond DECISION-1's two named cases — required by locked US-RES-002 AC-5 / US-RES-003 AC-5; recorded as scope clarification
- LanguageAligner.swift + AwakeningPipeline.swift (protected Core, outside the base Files list) modified minimally for DEF-52-001/DEF-60-001 — task MUST-resolve list; recorded as scope clarification
- SwiftLint config `included` resolves to non-existent root dirs (code under Echo/), so CI lint covers EchoTests/EchoUITests only — pre-existing quirk; R-007 enforced by validate_static_bans.py + CI grep scans
- UI tests now pass `-ui-language en-US` because LanguageCenter persists language in the app sandbox and unit tests may leave zh-Hans; no gate weakened (assertions unchanged)

## Deferred Items
Resolved in this PR (deferred-items.json tracking_status=resolved, resolved_at=2026-08-12): DEF-41-1, DEF-41-2, DEF-42-002, DEF-43-001, DEF-44-001, DEF-45-001, DEF-46-001, DEF-52-001, DEF-60-001 (i18n/AX), DEF-39-1 (L1~L4 error injection), DEF-59-004 (migration export PrivacyCheckpoint). No new deferred items created. Remaining open items (DEF-38-003 coverage threshold, DEF-50-001, DEF-55-*, DEF-56-007/008/009, DEF-57-002/003, DEF-58-*, DEF-59-001/002/003/005/006/007, DEF-60-002) are out of 3F.10 scope and tracked for 3F.11/Phase 4.

## Self-Check
- R-006: new Actor methods start with PrivacyCheckpoint — DeviceMigrationActor.exportPackage/importPackage validate(.migration); Pipelines scan clean
- R-007: no Combine / @unchecked Sendable / nonisolated(unsafe) — validate_static_bans.py + CI scans clean; Preview simulateError helpers now Release-compilable without banned constructs
- R-008: all cross-Actor calls awaited
- No hardcoded language strings: validate_localization.py 336 keys, 0 view violations
- Audit logs hash-only (contentHash) per AGENTS.md §5.4
- Branch/commit/PR: English per AGENTS.md §3.1/§3.2/§3.5; no `gh pr merge`, no `--delete-branch`
- No media artifacts persisted; run manifest visualMediaCaptured=false
- No fixture/Preview state presented as production-completion evidence (Live Sim Review used real app + fixture-driven banner states per established 3F pattern)

## Entry: 3F.finalize — Record 3F.11 merge and unlock Phase 4

- **id:** `3F.finalize`
- **title:** `Record 3F.11 merge and unlock Phase 4`
- **status before trigger:** `blocked_on_human_merge`
- **owner:** Release Manager
- **approver:** Human merge actor and Product and Architecture Lead
- **documents_required:** `docs/05-planning/task-status.json`; `docs/05-planning/phase3f-evidence-index.md`; `docs/05-planning/phase3f-execution-plan.md`; `docs/05-planning/开发计划安排文档.md`
- **dependencies:** `3F.11` PR merged into `dev-1.0`, host reports immutable merge commit SHA
- **acceptance_evidence:** 3F.11 PR URL; merge commit SHA reachable from `dev-1.0`; merged head and base identities; finalizer actor/time; Phase 4 ready-task diff; evidence-index link; proof that no branch was deleted
- **prohibited:** running before merge, accepting a PR head SHA as merge SHA, changing gate results, fabricating post-merge evidence, starting Phase 4 implementation in the finalizer change

This entry is a human-triggered post-merge finalizer record (`§10.1`). It has no `§11.1` PR-body marker pair. It is populated only by the human-triggered finalizer after the `3F.11` PR is merged; until then it remains `blocked_on_human_merge` with no merge SHA, no `done` status and no Phase 4 unlock.
